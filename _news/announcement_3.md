I am excited to announce that I have started studying at 42 Heilbronn, an innovative coding school known for its peer-to-peer learning and project-based curriculum. As part of this program, I am focusing on programming languages like C, C++, and shell scripting, as well as foundational computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and containerization. I look forward to developing my skills and working on real-world projects in this dynamic learning environment.
