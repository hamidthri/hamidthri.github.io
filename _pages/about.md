<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 10px;">
  Hello,
</div>

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 10px;">
  I’m a researcher with a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering – Control, with a focus on computer vision, reinforcement learning, and control systems. My thesis centered on mobile robot navigation using RL, applying deep learning and control techniques in robotics.
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
  I recently completed an internship in the computer vision team at Schwarz IT KG, where I contributed to AI-based projects and advanced my skills in Python, C++, and deep learning.
</p>

<div style="margin-top: 10px;">
  My recent work involves computer vision, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, with additional exploration in diffusion models and Transformers. I enjoy working at the intersection of learning-based methods and robotics.
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
  <strong>I am currently open to Ph.D. opportunities</strong> in computer vision, robotics, autonomous systems, and deep reinforcement learning.
