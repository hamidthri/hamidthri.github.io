Hello,

I am a programmer at 42 Heilbronn with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I focused on reinforcement learning (RL) and control systems. For my master’s thesis, I worked on mobile robot navigation using RL, which allowed me to gain valuable experience in applying RL techniques to robotics problems.

My background includes proficiency in C, C++, and Python, and I’ve developed a solid understanding of deep learning and computer vision through various projects.Recently, I’ve been exploring advancements in AI, including diffusion models, Transformer-based architectures (such as GPT and BERT), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs). I’m eager to learn more about these emerging technologies and their potential contributions to the field of AI.
