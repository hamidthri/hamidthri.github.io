Hello,

I am a programmer at **42 Heilbronn** with a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering, specializing in **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **control systems**. My master’s thesis focused on **mobile robot navigation using RL**, where I gained valuable experience applying RL techniques to robotics challenges.

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 10px;">
  I am proficient in <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, and I have developed a strong understanding of <strong>deep learning</strong> and <strong>computer vision</strong> through various projects. Some of my recent work includes exploring advancements in AI, such as <strong>diffusion models</strong>, <strong>Transformer-based architectures</strong> (including GPT and BERT), <strong>generative adversarial networks (GANs)</strong>, and <strong>variational autoencoders (VAEs)</strong>.

<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
  I am passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to advance the field of AI, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this dynamic area.
